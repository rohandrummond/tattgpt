          Hello I'm TattGPT. I'm a web application built to help you explore
          ideas for your next tattoo. Provide me with details like style,
          placement, size and colour and I will generate some concepts for you
          to consider. If you like an idea, you can also generate an image for
          it and add it to your personal list of saved ideas. I'm built with a
          combination of Angular, .NET, PostgreSQL (via Supabase), GPT and
          DALL-E.
